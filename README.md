# Physics212_final
MCMC analysis of Planck 2018 data to infer baseline Lambda-CDM parameters. Final project for Physics212 in 2019 Fall.

* MCMC.py contains the entire program for running the Markov chain.
* plik folder contains the Planck 2018 dataset, from https://pla.esac.esa.int/#home
* plc3.0 folder contains the package used to read the Planck 2018 dataset and calculate likelihood, from https://pla.esac.esa.int/#home
* MCMC requires CAMB and numpy.
* data_and_plotting_script contains the text file from each chain and python script to calculate posterior statistics, conduct Gelman-Rubin tests, and generate all plots.
